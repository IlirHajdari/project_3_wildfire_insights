## Background

Today, forest fires result in twice as much tree cover loss globally as two decades ago, and have accounted for 42% of tree cover loss in North America, 62% in Russia, China, and South Asia, and 39% in Oceana between 2001 and 2023.[^1] [^2]

Focusing on the United States, prior research finds that over the 1992 to 2012 period, while climate change and lightning were contributing factors, "human-started wildfires accounted for 84% of all wildfires, tripled the length of the fire season, dominated an area seven times greater than that affected by lightning fires, and were responsible for nearly half of all area burned," leading to a call for policy efforts to reduce the role of human-driven fires.[^3] Cost impact data for 1992 to 2024, however, indicate that of the $138.6 billion in damages and 495 deaths associated with 21 billion-dollar wildfire events over the extended period, approximately three-quarters of these effects ($108.6 billion in damages and 369 deaths) have concentrated in the most recent 10 years, suggesting that human-started wildfires have been accelerating.

In this analysis we examine the number, size, and causes of 2.3 million geo-referenced wildfire events in the United States over the 1992 to 2020 period in the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD).
