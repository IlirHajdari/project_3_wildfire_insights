This page explores data in the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD), which includes 2.3 million geo-referenced wildfire records in the United States, representing a total of 180 million acres burned during the 29-year period from 1992 to 2020.

## Background

Today, forest fires result in twice as much tree cover loss globally as two decades ago, and have accounted for 42% of tree cover loss in North America, 62% in Russia, China, and South Asia, and 39% in Oceana between 2001 and 2023. (1, 2)

In the United States, 23 billion-dollar wildfire events since 1990 have cost a total of $147.9 billion in damages and resulted in 537 deaths, with approximately three-quarters of these effects ($108.6 billion in damages and 369 deaths) concentrating in the most recent 10 years alone. (3, 4)

To reverse these trends requires understanding underlying causes, and how causal risks vary across regions, toward developing targeted mitigation efforts.
